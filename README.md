# Job_Ads_Fraud_Detection

This repository contains a machine learning project that analyzes data from CSV files. Before running the Python scripts, please make sure you have the following CSV files available in the repository:

- `XY_train.csv`
- `X_test.csv`

Once you have the CSV files in the repository, follow these steps to run the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python packages.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
4. Run `Ads_Fraud_Dectection_Part1.py` to execute the first script.
5. Run `Ads_Fraud_Dectection_Part2.py` to execute the second script.

Please note that the scripts use relative file paths, so it is essential to have the required CSV files directly in the repository to avoid any path-related issues.
